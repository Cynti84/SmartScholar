          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>SmartScholar is a web-based platform that aggregates and presents scholarship opportunities and enables students and verified providers to interact with listings. These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your access and use of SmartScholar.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="acceptance" class="section">
          <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>By accessing or using SmartScholar you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the platform.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="user-accounts" class="section">
          <h2>Accounts &amp; Roles</h2>
          <p>SmartScholar supports three principal roles: Students, Providers, and Administrators. Users must provide accurate information when creating accounts. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activities performed under your account.</p>

        <section id="provider-verification" class="section">
          <h2>Provider Verification</h2>
          <p>Provider accounts may require verification. Providers submit documentation for review. Until verified, provider features (such as publishing live scholarships) may be limited. Admin approval is required to ensure legitimacy of providers and to protect users from fraudulent listings.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="scholarship-listings" class="section">
          <h2>Scholarship Listings</h2>
          <p>Scholarships are contributed by providers. SmartScholar does not create or guarantee the validity of external scholarships; instead the platform implements verification and moderation workflows to reduce fraud. Each listing links to the provider’s official application page; SmartScholar does not process external applications on behalf of users.</p>
